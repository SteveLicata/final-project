About this app:

Songs4Strings is a music app for beginner guitarists or pro guitarists that are gigging musicians. Use the app to search Guitar Party for a song or chord. View the guitar chords, guitar tab, and lyrics to the song, and save them to your Songbook. Create Setlists of your saved songs, and place them in whatever order you like for your next gig. Also, search for a chord and save it to your own Chordbook.
